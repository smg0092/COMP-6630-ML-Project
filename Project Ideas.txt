Project Ideas: 


	Image Processing: 
		Dogs v Cats
		Chairs v Tables
		Apples v Oranges 
		Destroyed (signal corrupted) vs Normal Imagery


		See if we can take image data and... 
			- apply a genetic algorithm to our learning
			- do some kind of math function on it 
			- Image learn from the graph data itself? 
		
	
	NLP: 


	Regular Learning: 
		
		See if we can identify and classify health based on a dataset? 
		See if we can estimate how much housing prices will grow based on previous trends 
		Calculate how much FastFood chicken sandwhich prices will increase over time?
