Project Ideas: 


	Image Processing: 
		Dogs v Cats
		Chairs v Tables
		Apples v Oranges 
		Destroyed (signal corrupted) vs Normal Imagery


		See if we can take image data and... 
			- apply a genetic algorithm to our learning
			- do some kind of math function on it 
			- Image learn from the graph data itself? 
			
	
	
	NLP: 

        Identify what category a news article is given its title (I did this last year) (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tG1SxiFquIlcMQLXjNHxq2diPuFj9yFy#scrollTo=rxpy4ssxDMHO)



	Regular Learning:

		See if we can identify and classify health based on a dataset?
		See if we can estimate how much housing prices will grow based on previous trends
		Calculate how much FastFood chicken sandwhich prices will increase over time?
